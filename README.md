# Python Web Server & Client

A minimal **client-server** project built with Python sockets.  
This implementation shows how HTTP requests and responses work at a low level, without any external libraries.

## Features

### Web Server
- Listens on a TCP port (default: `28333`).
- Accepts raw socket connections.
- Parses incoming HTTP requests.
- Prints requests to the console for debugging and learning.

### Web Client
- Connects to a server and port.
- Sends a basic HTTP `GET /` request.
- Displays the serverâ€™s response in the console.
